  Taken from User Stories

  Scenario: As a MLOps engineer I would like to store Model name
    Given I have a connection to MR
    When I store a RegisteredModel with name "Pricing Model" and a child VersionedModel with name "v1" and a child Artifact with uri "s3://12345"
    Then there should be a mlmd Context of type "odh.RegisteredModel" named "Pricing Model"
    And there should be a mlmd Context of type "odh.ModelVersion" having property named "model_name" valorised with string value "Pricing Model"
